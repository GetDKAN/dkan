## Components

DKAN consists of three main components:

### DKAN Distro

This is the installation profile that packages everything together. It included the DKAN theme, faceted search, and other elements.

### DKAN Dataset

DKAN Dataset is a stand-alone module: https://github.com/nuams/dkan_dataset that provides dataset and resource content types. This is the foundation for the open data publishing. **DKAN Dataset can be included in any Drupal 7 site**.

The dataset nodes contain the metadata and the resource nodes contain the file or data itself. This is exactly how CKAN does it, but in Drupal.  The metadata from the datasets are available in rdf(a) that is DCAT compliant as well as in JSON.

### DKAN Datastore

DKAN Datastore is a stand-alone module: https://github.com/nuams/dkan_datastore that provides the ability to include uploaded files into a datastore and expose their components via an API. **DKAN Datastore can be included in any Drupal 7 site**.
