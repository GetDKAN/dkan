Feature: Search
  In order to see a dataset 
  As a website user
  I need to be able to search for a word

  Scenario: Searching for a dataset 
    Given I am on "/"
    When I fill in "query" with "Madison" in the "header" region
      And I press "edit-submit-dataset"
    Then I should see "Wisconsin Polling Places"

  Scenario: See number of datasets on search page 
    Given I am on "/dataset" 
    Then I should see "4 datasets"
      And I should see "US National Foreclosure Statistics January 2012"

  Scenario: Filter by facet tag 
    Given I am on "/dataset" 
    When I click "politics" 
    Then I should not see "Wisconsin Polling Places"

  Scenario: Filter by facet group 
    Given I am on "/dataset" 
    When I click "Data Explorer Examples" 
    Then I should see "US National Foreclosure Statistics January 2012"
    But I should not see "Wisconsin Polling Places"
