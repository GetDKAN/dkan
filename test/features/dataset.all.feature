  # TODO: 5 datasets are created in the test but the DKAN site has 4 datasets pre-made,
  #       with 2 of the datasets created are unpublished so the
  #       default search page will have 7 datasets instead of 3
  #       the expected number of datasets are increased to reflect this, but should be fixed later
