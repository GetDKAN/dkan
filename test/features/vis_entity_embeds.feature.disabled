Feature: Visualization entity embed test.

    #TODO: Works up until adding a visualization, where it cannot find the newly added VE Chart contnet.
    #       Need to ensure that the chart is created by the time the test gets to adding the embed.
  Scenario: Module visualization entity embed enabled by default
      Given "dkan_data_story" content:
          | title                           | author      | status   |
          | DKAN Data Story Test Story Post | admin       | 0        |
      And "ve_chart" content:
          | title                           | author      | status   |
          | Viz Entity Test Chart           | admin       | 0        |
      And I am logged in as a user with the "site manager" role
