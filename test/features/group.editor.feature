Feature: Site Manager administer groups
  In order to manage site organization
  As a Site Manager
  I want to administer groups

  Portal administrators needs to be able to create, edit, and delete
  groups. They need to be able to set group membership by adding and removing
  users and setting group roles and permissions.

      | Group 02 | Badmin | Yes       |
      | Group 03 | Badmin | No        |
    And group memberships:
      | user    | group    | role on group        | membership status |
      | Gabriel | Group 01 | administrator member | Active            |

      | Jaz     | Group 01 | member               | Pending           |
      | Celeste | Group 02 | member               | Active            |
    And datasets:
