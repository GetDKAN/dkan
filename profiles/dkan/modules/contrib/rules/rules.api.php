/**
 * Define rules compatible actions.
 *
 * This hook is required in order to add a new rules action. It should be
 * placed into the file MODULENAME.rules.inc, which gets automatically included
 * when the hook is invoked.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array of information about the module's provided rules actions.
 *   The array contains a sub-array for each action, with the action name as
 *   the key. Actions names may only contain lowercase alpha-numeric characters
 *   and underscores and should be prefixed with the providing module name.
 *   Possible attributes for each sub-array are:
 *   - label: The label of the action. Start capitalized. Required.
 *   - group: A group for this element, used for grouping the actions in the
 *     interface. Should start with a capital letter and be translated.
 *     Required.
 *   - parameter: (optional) An array describing all parameter of the action
 *     with the parameter's name as key. Each parameter has to be
 *     described by a sub-array with possible attributes as described
 *     afterwards, whereas the name of a parameter needs to be a lowercase,
 *     valid PHP variable name.
 *   - provides: (optional) An array describing the variables the action
 *     provides to the evaluation state with the variable name as key. Each
 *     variable has to be described by a sub-array with possible attributes as
 *     described afterwards, whereas the name of a parameter needs to be a
 *     lowercase, valid PHP variable name.
 *   - 'named parameter': (optional) If set to TRUE, the arguments will be
 *     passed as a single array with the parameter names as keys. This emulates
 *     named parameters in PHP and is in particular useful if the number of
 *     parameters can vary. Defaults to FALSE.
 *   - base: (optional) The base for action implementation callbacks to use
 *     instead of the action's name. Defaults to the action name.
 *   - callbacks: (optional) An array which allows to set specific function
 *     callbacks for the action. The default for each callback is the actions
 *     base appended by '_' and the callback name.
 *   - 'access callback': (optional) A callback which has to return whether the
 *     currently logged in user is allowed to configure this action. See
 *     rules_node_integration_access() for an example callback.
 *  Each 'parameter' array may contain the following properties:
 *   - label: The label of the parameter. Start capitalized. Required.
 *   - type: The rules data type of the parameter, which is to be passed to the
 *     action. All types declared in hook_rules_data_info() may be specified, as
 *     well as an array of possible types. Also lists and lists of a given type
 *     can be specified by using the notating list<integer> as introduced by
 *     the entity metadata module, see hook_entity_property_info(). The special
 *     keyword '*' can be used when all types should be allowed. Required.
 *   - bundles: (optional) An array of bundle names. When the specified type is
 *     set to a single entity type, this may be used to restrict the allowed
 *     bundles.
 *   - description: (optional) If necessary, a further description of the
 *     parameter.
 *   - options list: (optional) A callback that returns an array of possible
 *     values for this parameter. The callback has to return an array as used
 *     by hook_options_list(). For an example implementation see
 *     rules_data_action_type_options().
 *   - save: (optional) If this is set to TRUE, the parameter will be saved by
 *     rules when the rules evaluation ends. This is only supported for savable
 *     data types. If the action returns FALSE, saving is skipped.
 *   - optional: (optional) May be set to TRUE, when the parameter isn't
 *     required.
 *   - 'default value': (optional) The value to pass to the action, in case the
 *     parameter is optional and there is no specified value.
 *   - 'allow null': (optional) Usually Rules will not pass any NULL values as
 *     argument, but abort the evaluation if a NULL value is present. If set to
 *     TRUE, Rules will not abort and pass the NULL value through. Defaults to
 *     FALSE.
 *   - restriction: (optional) Restrict how the argument for this parameter may
 *     be provided. Supported values are 'selector' and 'input'.
 *   - default mode: (optional) Customize the default mode for providing the
 *     argument value for a parameter. Supported values are 'selector' and
 *     'input'. The default depends on the required data type.
 *   - sanitize: (optional) Allows parameters of type 'text' to demand an
 *     already sanitized argument. If enabled, any user specified value won't be
 *     sanitized itself, but replacements applied by input evaluators are as
 *     well as values retrieved from selected data sources.
 *   - translatable: (optional) If set to TRUE, the provided argument value
 *     of the parameter is translatable via i18n String translation. This is
 *     applicable for textual parameters only, i.e. parameters of type 'text',
 *     'token', 'list<text>' and 'list<token>'. Defaults to FALSE.
 *   - ui class: (optional) Allows overriding the UI class, which is used to
 *     generate the configuration UI of a parameter. Defaults to the UI class of
 *     the specified data type.
 *   - cleaning callback: (optional) A callback that input evaluators may use
 *     to clean inserted replacements; e.g. this is used by the token evaluator.
 *   - wrapped: (optional) Set this to TRUE in case the data should be passed
 *     wrapped. This only applies to wrapped data types, e.g. entities.
 *  Each 'provides' array may contain the following properties:
 *   - label: The label of the variable. Start capitalized. Required.
 *   - type: The rules data type of the variable. All types declared in
 *     hook_rules_data_info() may be specified. Types may be parametrized e.g.
 *     the types node<page> or list<integer> are valid.
 *   - save: (optional) If this is set to TRUE, the provided variable is saved
 *     by rules when the rules evaluation ends. Only possible for savable data
 *     types. Defaults to FALSE.
 *
 *  The module has to provide an implementation for each action, being a
 *  function named as specified in the 'base' key or for the execution callback.
 *  All other possible callbacks are optional.
 *  Supported action callbacks by rules are defined and documented in the
 *  RulesPluginImplInterface. However any module may extend the action plugin
 *  based upon a defined interface using hook_rules_plugin_info(). All methods
 *  defined in those interfaces can be overridden by the action implementation.
 *  The callback implementations for those interfaces may reside in any file
 *  specified in hook_rules_file_info().

/**

 *     relationship, which will be only used for checking compatible types. E.g.
 *     the 'entity' data type is parent of the 'node' data type, thus a node may
 *     be also used for any action needing an 'entity' parameter. Can be set to
 *     any known rules data type.
 *   - ui class: (optional) Specify a class that is used to generate the
 *     configuration UI to configure parameters of this type. The given class
 *     must extend RulesDataUI and may implement the
 *     RulesDataDirectInputFormInterface in order to allow the direct data input
 *     configuration mode. Defaults to RulesDataUI.
 *   - wrap: (optional) If set to TRUE, the data is wrapped internally using
 *     wrappers provided by the entity API module. This is required for entities
 *     and data structures to support selecting a property via the data selector
 *     and for intelligent saving.
 *   - is wrapped: (optional) In case the data wrapper is already wrapped when
 *     passed to Rules and Rules should not unwrap it when passing the data as
 *     argument, e.g. to an action, set this to TRUE. The default FALSE is fine
 *     in most cases.
 *   - wrapper class: (optional) Allows the specification of a custom wrapper
 *     class, which has to inherit from 'EntityMetadataWrapper'. If given Rules
 *     makes use of the class for wrapping the data of the given type. However
 *     note that if data is already wrapped when it is passed to Rules, the

 *     for a custom wrapper class. See RulesIdentifiableDataWrapper for details.
 *   - property info: (optional) May be used for non-entity data structures to
 *     provide info about the data properties, such that data selectors via an
 *     entity metadata wrapper are supported. Specify an array as expected by
 *     the $info parameter of entity_metadata_wrapper().

 *     callback that makes use of the property info to create a new instance of
 *     this data type. Entities should use hook_entity_info() to specify the
 *     'creation callback' instead, as utilized by the entity API module. See
 *     rules_action_data_create_array() for an example callback.
 *   - property defaults: (optional) May be used for non-entity data structures
 *     to to provide property info defaults for the data properties. Specify an
 *     array as expected by entity_metadata_wrapper().
 *   - group: (optional) A group for this element, used for grouping the data
 *     types in the interface. Should start with a capital letter and be
 *     translated.
 *   - token type: (optional) The type name as used by the token module.
 *     Defaults to the type name as used by rules. Use FALSE to let token ignore
 *     this type.
 *   - cleaning callback: (optional) A callback that input evaluators may use
 *     to clean inserted replacements; e.g. this is used by the token evaluator.

 *     components (see below).
 *   - class: The implementation class. Has to extend the RulesPlugin class.
 *   - embeddable: A container class in which elements of those plugin may be
 *     embedded via the UI or FALSE to disallow embedding it via the UI. This
 *     has no implications on the API level though. Common classes that are
 *     used here are RulesConditionContainer and RulesActionContainer.
 *   - component: If set to TRUE, the rules admin UI will list elements of those
 *     plugin in the components UI and allows the creation of new components
 *     based upon this plugin. Optional.
 *   - extenders: This allows one to specify faces extenders, which may be used
 *     to dynamically implement interfaces. Optional. All extenders specified
 *     here are setup automatically by rules once the object is created. To
 *     specify set this to an array, where the keys are the implemented
 *     interfaces pointing to another array with the keys:
 *     - class: The class of the extender, implementing the FacesExtender
 *       and the specified interface. Either 'class' or 'methods' has to exist.
 *     - methods: An array of callbacks that implement the methods of the
 *       interface where the method names are the keys and the callback names
 *       the values. There has to be a callback for each defined method.
 *     - file: An optional array describing the file to include when a method
 *       of the interface is invoked. The array entries known are 'type',
 *       'module', and 'name' matching the parameters of module_load_include().
 *       Only 'module' is required as 'type' defaults to 'inc' and 'name' to
 *       NULL.
 *   - overrides: An optional array, which may be used to specify callbacks to
 *     override specific methods. For that the following keys are supported:
 *     - methods: As in the extenders array, but you may specify as many methods
 *       here as you like.
 *     - file: Optionally an array specifying a file to include for a method.
 *       For each method appearing in methods a file may be specified by using
 *       the method name as key and another array as value, which describes the
 *       file to include - looking like the file array supported by 'extenders'.
 *   - import keys: (optional) Embeddable plugins may specify an array of import
 *     keys, which the plugin make use for exporting. Defaults to the upper
 *     case plugin name, thus the key 'OR' in an export triggers the creation
 *     of the 'or' plugin. Note that only uppercase values are allowed, as
