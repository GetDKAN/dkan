Drupal 7.26, 2014-01-15
----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-001.

Drupal 7.25, 2014-01-02
-----------------------
- Fixed a bug in node_save() which prevented the saved node from being updated
  in hook_node_insert() and other similar hooks.
- Added a meta tag to install.php to prevent it from being indexed by search
  engines even when Drupal is installed in a subfolder (minor markup change).
- Fixed a bug in the database API that caused frequent deadlock errors when
  running merge queries on some servers.
- Performance improvement: Prevented block rehashing from writing blocks to the
  database on every cache clear and cron run when the blocks have not changed.
  This fix results in an extra 'saved' key which is added and set to TRUE for
  each block returned by _block_rehash() that actually is saved to the database
  (data structure change).
- Added an optional 'skip on cron' parameter to hook_cron_queue_info() to allow
  queues to avoid being automatically processed on cron runs (API addition).
- Fixed a bug which caused hook_block_view_MODULE_DELTA_alter() to never be
  invoked if the block delta had a hyphen in it. To implement the hook when the
  block delta has a hyphen, modules should now replace hyphens with underscores
  when constructing the function name for the hook implementation.
- Fixed a bug which caused cached pages to sometimes be sent to the browser
  with incorrect compression. The fix adds a new 'page_compressed' key to the
  $cache->data array returned by drupal_page_get_cache() (minor data structure
  change).
- Fixed broken tests on PHP 5.5.
- Made the File and Image modules more robust when saving entities that have
  deleted files attached. The code in file_field_presave() will now remove the
  record of the deleted file from the entity before saving (minor data
  structure change).
- Standardized menu callback functions throughout Drupal core to return
  MENU_NOT_FOUND and MENU_ACCESS_DENIED rather than printing their own "page
  not found" or "access denied" pages (minor API change in the return value of
  these functions under some circumstances).
- Fixed a bug in which caches were not properly cleared when a node was deleted
  via the administrative interface.
- Changed the Bartik theme to render content contained in <pre>, <code> and
  similar tags in a larger font size, so it is easier to read.
- Fixed a bug in the Search module that caused exceptions to be thrown during
  searches if the server was not configured to represent decimal points as a
  period.
- Fixed a regression in the Image module that made image_style_url() not work
  when a relative path (rather than a complete file URI) was passed to it.
- Added an optional feature to the Statistics module to allow node views to be
  tracked by Ajax requests rather than during the server-side generation of the
  page. This allows the node counter to work on sites that use external page
  caches (string change and new administrative option:
  https://drupal.org/node/2164069).
- Added a link to the drupal.org documentation page for cron to the Cron
  settings page (string change).
- Added a 'drupal_anonymous_user_object' variable to allow the anonymous user
  object returned by drupal_anonymous_user() to be overridden with a classed
  object (API addition).
- Changed the database API to allow inserts based on a SELECT * query to work
  correctly.
- Changed the database schema of the {file_managed} table to allow Drupal to
  manage files larger than 4 GB.
- Changed the File module's hook_field_load() implementation to prevent file
  entity properties which have the same name as file or image field properties
  from overwriting the field properties (minor API change).
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.24, 2013-11-20
----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities), see SA-CORE-2013-003.

-----------------------
- Fixed a fatal error on PostgreSQL databases when updating the Taxonomy module
  from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7.
- Fixed the default ordering of CSS files for sites using right-to-left
  languages, to consistently place the right-to-left override file immediately
  after the CSS it is overriding (API change: https://drupal.org/node/2058463).
- Added a drupal_check_memory_limit() API function to allow the memory limit to
  be checked consistently (API addition).
- Changed the default web.config file for IIS servers to allow favicon.ico
  files which are present in the filesystem to be accessed.
- Fixed inconsistent support for the 'tel' protocol in Drupal's URL filtering
  functions.
- Performance improvement: Allowed all hooks to be included in the
  module_implements() cache, even those that are only invoked on HTTP POST
  requests.
- Made the database system replace truncate queries with delete queries when
  inside a transaction, to fix issues with PostgreSQL and other databases.
- Fixed a bug which caused nested contextual links to display improperly.
- Fixed a bug which prevented cached image derivatives from being flushed for
  private files and other non-default file schemes.
- Fixed drupal_render() to always return an empty string when there is no
  output, rather than sometimes returning NULL (minor API change).
- Added protection to cache_clear_all() to ensure that non-cache tables cannot
  be truncated (API addition: a new isValidBin() method has been added to the
  default database cache implementation).
- Changed the default .htaccess file to support HTTP authorization in CGI
  environments.
- Changed the password reset form to pre-fill the username when requested via a
  URL query parameter, and used this in the error message that appears after a
  failed login attempt (minor data structure and behavior change).
- Fixed broken support for foreign keys in the field API.
- Fixed "No active batch" error when a user cancels their own account.
- Added a description to the "access content overview" permission on the
  permissions page (string change).
- Added a drupal_array_diff_assoc_recursive() function to allow associative
  arrays to be compared recursively (API addition).
- Added human-readable labels to image styles, in addition to the existing
  machine-readable name (API change: https://drupal.org/node/2058503).
- Moved the drupal_get_hash_salt() function to bootstrap.inc and used it in
  additional places in the code, for added security in the case where there is
  no hash salt in settings.php.
- Fixed a regression in Drupal 7.22 that caused internal server errors for
  sites running on very old Apache 1.x web servers.
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.22, 2013-04-03
-----------------------
- Allowed the drupal_http_request() function to be overridden so that
  additional HTTP request capabilities can be added by contributed modules.
- Changed the Simpletest module to allow PSR-0 test classes to be used in
  Drupal 7.
- Removed an unnecessary "Content-Disposition" header from private file
  downloads; it prevented many private files from being viewed inline in a web
  browser.
- Changed various field API functions to allow them to optionally act on a
  single field within an entity (API addition: http://drupal.org/node/1825844).
- Fixed a bug which prevented Drupal's file transfer functionality from working
  on some PHP 5.4 systems.
- Fixed incorrect log message when theme() is called for a theme hook that does
  not exist (minor string change).
- Fixed Drupal's token-replacement system to allow spaces in the token value.
- Changed the default behavior after a user creates a node they do not have
  access to view. The user will now be redirected to the front page rather than
  an access denied page.
- Fixed a bug which prevented empty HTTP headers (such as "0") from being set.
  (Minor behavior change: Callers of drupal_add_http_header() must now set
  FALSE explicitly to prevent a header from being sent at all; this was already
  indicated in the function's documentation.)
- Fixed OpenID errors when more than one module implements hook_openid(). The
  behavior is now changed so that if more than one module tries to set the same
  parameter, the last module's change takes effect.
- Fixed a serious documentation bug: The $name variable in the
  taxonomy-term.tpl.php theme template was incorrectly documented as being
  sanitized when in fact it is not.
- Fixed a bug which prevented Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrades on sites which had
  duplicate permission names in the User module's database tables.
- Added an empty "datatype" attribute to taxonomy term and username links to
  make the RDFa markup upward compatible with RDFa 1.1 (minor markup addition).
- Fixed a bug which caused the denial-of-service protection added in Drupal
  7.20 to break certain valid image URLs that had an extra slash in them.
- Fixed a bug with update queries in the SQLite database driver that prevented
  Drupal from being installed with SQLite on PHP 5.4.
- Fixed enforced dependencies errors updating to recent versions of Drupal 7 on
  certain non-MySQL databases.
- Refactored the Field module's caching behavior to obtain large improvements
  in memory usage for sites with many fields and instances (API addition:
  http://drupal.org/node/1915646).
- Fixed entity argument not being passed to implementations of
  hook_file_download_access_alter(). The fix adds an additional context
  parameter that can be passed when calling drupal_alter() for any hook (API
  change: http://drupal.org/node/1882722).
- Fixed broken support for translatable comment fields (API change:
  http://drupal.org/node/1874724).

  stale data in the Upload module's database tables.
- Fixed a bug in the States API which prevented certain types of form elements
  from being disabled when requested.
- Allowed aggregator feed items with author names longer than 255 characters to
  have a truncated version saved to the database (rather than causing a fatal
  error).
- Allowed aggregator feed items to have URLs longer than 255 characters
  (schema change which results in several columns in the Aggregator module's
  database tables changing from VARCHAR to TEXT fields).

  taxonomy terms to invoke hook_entity_view() and otherwise make it consistent
  with other entities (API change: http://drupal.org/node/1808870).
- Added hook_entity_view_mode_alter() to allow modules to change entity view
  modes on display (API addition: http://drupal.org/node/1833086).

- Modified the Update manager module to allow drupal.org to collect usage
  statistics for individual modules and themes, rather than only for entire
  projects.
- Modified the node listing database query on Drupal's default front page to
  add table aliases for better query altering (this is a data structure change
  affecting code which implements hook_query_alter() on this query).

  may access the language using entity_language() (API change:
  http://drupal.org/node/1626346).
- Added EntityFieldQuery support for taxonomy bundles.
- Fixed issue where field form structure was incomplete if field_access()
  returned FALSE. Instead of being incomplete, the form structure now has
  #access set to FALSE and field form validation is skipped (data structure
  change: http://drupal.org/node/1663020).
- Fixed data loss issue due to field_has_data() returning inconsistent results.
  The fix adds an optional DANGEROUS_ACCESS_CHECK_OPT_OUT tag to entity field

Drupal 7.0, 2011-01-05 
----------------------
- Database:
    * Fully rewritten database layer utilizing PHP 5's PDO abstraction layer.
    * Drupal now requires MySQL >= 5.0.15 or PostgreSQL >= 8.3.
    * Added query builders for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and SELECT queries.
    * Support for master/slave replication, transactions, multi-insert queries,
      and other features.
    * Added support for the SQLite database engine.
    * Default to InnoDB engine, rather than MyISAM, on MySQL when available.
      This offers increased scalability and data integrity.
- Security:
    * Protected cron.php -- cron will only run if the proper key is provided.
    * Implemented a pluggable password system and much stronger password hashes
      that are compatible with the Portable PHP password hashing framework.
    * Rate limited login attempts to prevent brute-force password guessing, and
      improved the flood control API to allow variable time windows and
      identifiers for limiting user access to resources.
    * Transformed the "Update status" module into the "Update manager" which
      can securely install or update modules and themes via a web interface.
- Usability:
    * Added contextual links (a.k.a. local tasks) to page elements, such as
      blocks, nodes, or comments, which allows to perform the most common tasks
      with a single click only.
    * Improved installer requirements check.
    * Improved support for integration of WYSIWYG editors.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for input format listings.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for language listing.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for poll options.
    * Provided descriptions and human-readable names for user permissions.
    * Removed comment controls for users.
    * Removed display order settings for comment module. Comment display
      order can now be customized using the Views module.
    * Removed the 'related terms' feature from taxonomy module since this can
      now be achieved with Field API.
    * Added additional features to the default installation profile, and
      implemented a "slimmed down" profile designed for developers.
    * Added a built-in, automated cron run feature, which is triggered by site
      visitors.
    * Added an administrator role which is assigned all permissions for
      installed modules automatically.
    * Image toolkits are now provided by modules (rather than requiring a
      manual file copy to the includes directory).
    * Added an edit tab to taxonomy term pages.
    * Redesigned password strength validator.
    * Redesigned the add content type screen.
    * Highlight duplicate URL aliases.
    * Renamed "input formats" to "text formats".
    * Moved text format permissions to the main permissions page.
    * Added configurable ability for users to cancel their own accounts.
    * Added "vertical tabs", a reusable interface component that features
      automatic summaries and increases usability.
    * Replaced fieldsets on node edit and add pages with vertical tabs.
- Performance:
    * Improved performance on uncached page views by loading multiple core
      objects in a single database query.
    * Improved performance for logged-in users by reducing queries for path
      alias lookups.
    * Improved support for HTTP proxies (including reverse proxies), allowing
      anonymous page views to be served entirely from the proxy.
- Documentation:
    * Hook API documentation now included in Drupal core.
- News aggregator:
    * Added OPML import functionality for RSS feeds.
    * Optionally, RSS feeds may be configured to not automatically generate feed blocks.
- Search:
    * Added support for language-aware searches.
- Aggregator:
    * Introduced architecture that allows pluggable parsers and processors for
      syndicating RSS and Atom feeds.
    * Added options to suspend updating specific feeds and never discard feeds
      items.
- Testing:
    * Added test framework and tests.
- Improved time zone support:
    * Drupal now uses PHP's time zone database when rendering dates in local
      time. Site-wide and user-configured time zone offsets have been converted
      to time zone names, e.g. Africa/Abidjan.
    * In some cases the upgrade and install scripts do not choose the preferred
      site default time zone. The automatically-selected time zone can be
      corrected at admin/config/regional/settings.
    * If your site is being upgraded from Drupal 6 and you do not have the
      contributed date or event modules installed, user time zone settings will
      fallback to the system time zone and will have to be reconfigured by each user.
    * User-configured time zones now serve as the default time zone for PHP
      date/time functions.
- Filter system:
    * Revamped the filter API and text format storage.
    * Added support for default text formats to be assigned on a per-role basis.
    * Refactored the HTML corrector to take advantage of PHP 5 features.
- User system:
    * Added clean API functions for creating, loading, updating, and deleting
      user roles and permissions.
    * Refactored the "access rules" component of user module: The user module
      now provides a simple interface for blocking single IP addresses. The
      previous functionality in the user module for restricting certain e-mail
      addresses and usernames is now available as a contributed module. Further,
      IP address range blocking is no longer supported and should be implemented
      at the operating system level.
    * Removed per-user themes: Contributed modules with similar functionality
      are available.
- OpenID:
    * Added support for Gmail and Google Apps for Domain identifiers. Users can
      now login with their user@example.com identifier when example.com is powered
      by Google.
    * Made the OpenID module more pluggable.
- Added code registry:
    * Using the registry, modules declare their includable files via their .info file,
      allowing Drupal to lazy-load classes and interfaces as needed.
- Theme system:
    * Removed the Bluemarine, Chameleon and Pushbutton themes. These themes live
      on as contributed themes (http://drupal.org/project/bluemarine,
      http://drupal.org/project/chameleon and http://drupal.org/project/pushbutton).
    * Added Stark theme to make analyzing Drupal's default HTML and CSS easier.
    * Added Seven as the default administration theme.
    * Variable preprocessing of theme hooks prior to template rendering now goes
      through two phases: a 'preprocess' phase and a new 'process' phase. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Theme hooks implemented as functions (rather than as templates) can now
      also have preprocess (and process) functions. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Added Bartik as the default theme.
- File handling:
    * Files are now first class Drupal objects with file_load(), file_save(),
      and file_validate() functions and corresponding hooks.
    * The file_move(), file_copy() and file_delete() functions now operate on
      file objects and invoke file hooks so that modules are notified and can
      respond to changes.
    * For the occasions when only basic file manipulation are needed--such as
      uploading a site logo--that don't require the overhead of databases and
      hooks, the current unmanaged copy, move and delete operations have been
      preserved but renamed to file_unmanaged_*().
    * Rewrote file handling to use PHP stream wrappers to enable support for
      both public and private files and to support pluggable storage mechanisms
      and access to remote resources (e.g. S3 storage or Flickr photos).
    * The mime_extension_mapping variable has been removed. Modules that need to
      alter the default MIME type extension mappings should implement
      hook_file_mimetype_mapping_alter().
    * Added the hook_file_url_alter() hook, which makes it possible to serve
      files from a CDN.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading files, previously provided by
      the contributed module FileField.
- Image handling:
    * Improved image handling, including better support for add-on image
      libraries.
    * Added API and interface for creating advanced image thumbnails.
    * Inclusion of additional effects such as rotate and desaturate.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading images, previously provided by
      the contributed module ImageField.
- Added aliased multi-site support:
    * Added support for mapping domain names to sites directories.
- Added RDF support:
    * Modules can declare RDF namespaces which are serialized in the <html> tag
      for RDFa support.
    * Modules can specify how their data structure maps to RDF.
    * Added support for RDFa export of nodes, comments, terms, users, etc. and
      their fields.
- Search engine optimization and web linking:
    * Added a rel="canonical" link on node and comment pages to prevent
      duplicate content indexing by search engines.
    * Added a default rel="shortlink" link on node and comment pages that
      advertises a short link as an alternative URL to third-party services.
    * Meta information is now alterable by all modules before rendering.
- Field API:
    * Custom data fields may be attached to nodes, users, comments and taxonomy
      terms.
    * Node bodies and teasers are now Field API fields instead of
      being a hard-coded property of node objects.
    * In addition, any other object type may register with Field API
      and allow custom data fields to be attached to itself.
    * Provides most of the features of the former Content Construction
      Kit (CCK) module.
    * Taxonomy terms are now Field API fields that can be added to any fieldable
      object.
- Installer:
    * Refactored the installer into an API that allows Drupal to be installed
      via a command line script.
- Page organization
    * Made the help text area a full featured region with blocks.
    * Site mission is replaced with the highlighted content block region and
      separate RSS feed description settings.
    * The footer message setting was removed in favor of custom blocks.
    * Made the main page content a block which can be moved and ordered
      with other blocks in the same region.
    * Blocks can now return structured arrays for later rendering just
      like page callbacks.
- Translation system
    * The translation system now supports message context (msgctxt).
    * Added support for translatable fields to Field API.
- JavaScript changes
    * Upgraded the core JavaScript library to jQuery version 1.4.4.
    * Upgraded the jQuery Forms library to 2.52.
    * Added jQuery UI 1.8.7, which allows improvements to Drupal's user
      experience.
- Better module version support
    * Modules now can specify which version of another module they depend on.
- Removed modules from core
    * The following modules have been removed from core, because contributed
      modules with similar functionality are available:
      * Blog API module
      * Ping module
      * Throttle module
- Improved node access control system.
    * All modules may now influence the access to a node at runtime, not just
      the module that defined a node.
    * Users may now be allowed to bypass node access restrictions without giving
      them complete access to the site.
    * Access control affects both published and unpublished nodes.
    * Numerous other improvements to the node access system.
- Actions system
    * Simplified definitions of actions and triggers.
    * Removed dependency on the combination of hooks and operations. Triggers
      now directly map to module hooks.
- Task handling
    * Added a queue API to process many or long-running tasks.
    * Added queue API support to cron API.
    * Added a locking framework to coordinate long-running operations across
      requests.

    * Because many people would love to see their website showing a lot less of English, and far more of their own language, Drupal provides a framework to set up a multi-lingual website or to overwrite the default English text in English.
- Added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * Users can be granted access to specific administration sections. Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
- Added FAQ module
- Changed the "open submission queue" into a (optional) module.
- Various updates:
    * Improved account module:
        + User accounts can be deleted.
        + Added fine-grained permission support.
    * Improved block module
    * Improved diary module:
        + Diary entries can be deleted
    * Improved headline module:
        + Improved parser to support more "generic" RDF/RSS/XML backend.
    * Improved module module
    * Improved watchdog module
    * Improved database abstraction layer
    * Improved themes:
        + W3C validation on a best effort basis
        + Added theme "example" (alias "Stone Age")
    * Added new scripts to directory "scripts"
    * Added directory "misc"
    * Added CREDITS file
