**Notice: Avoiding PHP errors after upgrade**

In some cases, changes to the codebase may cause PHP errors when the Drupal bootstrap process looks for a file that no longer exists. As always, backing up your db before upgrading is recommended. In addition, if you get to a state in which Drupal will not bootstrap successfully due to an issue with views_autocomplete_filters, try some combination of:

$ drush sql-query 'DELETE FROM registry WHERE filename LIKE "%views_autocomplete_filters_handler_filter_string.inc%"';
$ drush cc all
$ drush rr

**Search page redesign**

This release of DKAN includes a redesigned search page, which is also the page used to browse datasets. This redesign required some changes to the included search indexes. Use the following drush commands to rebuild your search indexes, or go to admin/config/search/search_api/index/datasets and disable, re-enable and re-index the _datasets_ search index.

$ drush search-api-disable datasets -y
$ drush search-api-enable datasets -y
$ drush sapi-r -y
$ drush sapi-i -y

**Permissions/roles upgrade**

As mentioned above, this release includes a new module called DKAN Permissions (dkan_permissions), which is meant to replace the old DKAN Sitewide Roles and Permissions (dkan_sitewide_roles_perms). New installs of DKAN will enable this module and ignore the old one, while existing sites will see no change (but are recommended to upgrade).  See more information in the module's README file.

The command line method, including deleting the now-deprecated "storyteller" role, would look like this:

$ drush dis dkan_sitewide_roles_perms -y
$ drush rdel 'storyteller'
$ drush en dkan_permissions -y
$ drush fra -y
$ drush fr dkan_permissions -y

Group-level permissions have been moved to DKAN Dataset Groups Permissions. To start using them, enable the new module, and revert it using Features. Do this via the UI or on the command line with Drush:

$ drush en dkan_dataset_groups_perms -y
$ drush fr dkan_dataset_groups_perms -y

**Search API Database upgrade issue**

This release updates the Search API DB module, which, if you are using the database backend, may break
your search indexes, resulting in either a) nothing, or b) all nodes regardless of type on your search/datasets
pages.

To fix, follow these steps after updating your database:

1. Go to /admin/config/search/search_api/index/datasets/edit to edit the database node index
2. Set the Server to "< No Server >" and Save. Your index will now show as "disabled."
3. Edit it again (by clicking "Edit" next to "Database Node Index") and set the Server back to "Database Server" and Save.
4. Click the "enable" link while viewing the resulting page, or edit the index again and check the "Enabled" box.
5. Once the index is enabled, you should see "0/[total] Indexed" on the index page. Click "Index Now" at the bottom of the page to re-index all your datasets.
6. Repeat for any other indexes you have running on a database server.

This issue has been identified and documented for other Drupal distributions using Search API. See release notes for
the Panopoly (https://www.drupal.org/node/2425263) and OpenAtrium (https://www.drupal.org/node/2443025)
distros on Drupal.org.
