  [DKAN Tools](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-tools) is a project
  containing commands and tools that [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/dkan/)
  uses for our own implementations and deployments.

For either working on a project locally or working on the core DKAN software and libraries, using a standardized, [docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based local environment is recommended. Our DKAN Tools command-line utility will work on Mac or Linux to create containers for the various services needed by DKAN. This will ensure you have the same setup as DKAN's core developers, and that your environment is very close to that of our continuous integration tools.

It is possible, though not reccomended, to use DKAN Tools [without docker](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-tools/tree/master#running-without-docker) and using your system's native webserver, [PHP](https://www.php.net), and database tools; see the DKAN Tools [documentation](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-tools).

## Requirements

DKAN is based on Drupal software and -- generally -- runs anywhere Drupal is supported. For the most common setup, we reccomend:

-  MySQL: minimum version 5.5.3+ with PDO
-  PHP: minimum version 7.2.x
-  Apache: minimum version 2.x
-  Drush: minimum version 9.x.
-  Node: minimum version 8.10 (if using the decoupled frontend)

## Starting a new project

The DKAN team maintains a CLI tool to manage initial setup and local development environments for DKAN projects. Follow the instructions from the DKAN Tools documentation: [Starting a new project](https://getdkan.github.io/dkan-tools/#newproject/) to generate a new Drupal site with DKAN installed on your system.

DKAN tools bases new projects off of a [composer project](https://github.com/GetDKAN/recommended-project) that you can also use to start a project using your own toolset:

```
composer create-project getdkan/recommended-project my-project
```

Or simply create a project however you prefer and add a requirement for `getdkan/dkan`. **Do note** that a bug in Drupal core cron may cause problems with data imports, and applying [this patch](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3230541#comment-14206814) is highly recommended. The patch will be applied automatically if you use the recommended project.

## Installing DKAN

If you already have an existing Drupal site, install DKAN with [composer](https://www.drupal.org/node/2718229). You can find the [latest DKAN release here](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan/releases). Composer will download the module and all of the  dependencies it requires for the backend.

```
composer require 'getdkan/dkan'
```
