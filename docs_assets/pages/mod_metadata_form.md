@page form Metadata Form

The DKAN **Metadata Form** module is an embedded React app that makes it easy to add or edit json metadata.

In 1.x, metadata was stored in node fields, this made large harvest opperations hard on server performance. In 2.x all metadata is stored, imported, exported as JSON. This makes handling of large volumes of data more efficient.
