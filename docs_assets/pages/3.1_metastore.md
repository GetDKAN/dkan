@page metastore Metastore

The DKAN **Metastore** is responsible for [schemas](https://json-schema.org/) (descriptions of data, data types), and the data that conforms to those schemas.

DKAN's main data type is the @ref Dataset.

Out of the box DKAN provides and utilizes [DCAT-US Schema](https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/) for the datasets it will store. A number of json file containing schemas can be located at the root of the codebase in the schemas directory. The dataset schema is in the dataset.json file.

If you would like to use a different schema for your dataset check out the @ref ChangingYourDatasetSchema "Changing your Dataset Schema" section of the documentation.


## Configuration
@anchor ChangingYourDatasetSchema
### Changing your Dataset Schema
It is possible to add new fields to conform to additional specifications or custom requirements. DKAN supports changing which schema is used to validate dataset data being added to the catalog.

To change the schema being used, copy the `schema` directory from the DKAN repo and place it in the root of your Drupal installation. Then make any modifications necessary to the `dataset.json` file inside the `collections` directory.

@warning
  The schema is actively used by the catalog to verify the validity of the data. Making changes to the schema, after data is present in the catalog should be done with care as non-backward compatible changes to the schema could cause issues. Look at Drupal::metastore::SchemaRetriever::findSchemaDirectory() for context.
