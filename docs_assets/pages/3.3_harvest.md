@page harvest Harvest

The DKAN **Harvest** module enables you to use the public feed or API of another data portal and import items from that portalâ€™s catalog into your own.

For example, [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) harvests all of its datasets from the [data.json](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) files of [hundreds of U.S. federal, state and local data portals](https://catalog.data.gov/harvest).
