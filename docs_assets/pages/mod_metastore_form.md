@page form Metadata Form

The DKAN **Metadata Form** module is an embedded React app for adding or editing JSON metadata.

Metadata is stored, imported, and exported as JSON. This makes processing large volumes of data more efficient, but it is harder to edit specific values as they are stored as a single JSON object. This app will break out the metadata values into "fields" for easy editing.
