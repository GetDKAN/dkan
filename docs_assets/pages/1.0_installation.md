  [DKAN Tools](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-tools) is a project
  containing commands and tools that [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/dkan/)
  uses for our own implementations and deployments.

For either working on a project locally or working on the core DKAN software and libraries, using a standardized, [docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based local environment is recommended. Our DKAN Tools command-line utility will work on Mac or Linux to create containers for the various services needed by DKAN. This will ensure you have the same setup as DKAN's core developers, and that your environment is very close to that of our continuous integration tools.

It is possible, though not reccomended, to use DKAN Tools [without docker](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-tools/tree/master#running-without-docker) and using your system's native webserver, php, and database tools; see the DKAN Tools documentation.

## Requirements

DKAN is based on Drupal software and -- generally -- runs anywhere Drupal is supported. For the most common setup, we reccomend:

-  MySQL: minimum version 5.5.3+ with PDO
-  PHP: minimum version 7.2.x
-  Apache: minimum version 2.x
-  Drush: minimum version 9.x.

## Starting a new project

Follow the instructions on the DKAN Tools [README](https://github.com/getdkan/dkan-tools) to generate new Drupal site with DKAN installed on your system.

## Installing DKAN

If you already have an existing Drupal site, install DKAN with [composer](https://www.drupal.org/node/2718229). You can find the [latest release version here](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan/releases).

```
composer require 'getdkan/dkan:2.0.0'
```

## Dummy content

To populate your site with example content, enable the ``dkan_dummy_content`` module:

```
drush en dkan_dummy_content
```

to add and then remove the content use the following commands:

```
drush dkan-dummy-content:create
drush dkan-dummy-content:remove
```

## Decoupled front end

 DKAN for Drupal 8 works with a decoupled [React application](https://github.com/GetDKAN/data-catalog-frontend) as the frontend.

 **DKAN_frontend** is an integration module that allows the React App driving the frontend to be embedded in Drupal.

 If you are not using DKAN Tools, follow these steps to get the integration working:
 1. Place the source for the ``data-catalog-frontend`` inside of your ``docroot`` directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/GetDKAN/data-catalog-frontend.git
```

 2. Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/GetDKAN/data-catalog-frontend) of ``data-catalog-frontend``, but instead of runnig the development server at the end, build a copy with ``npm run build``
 3. Enable the integration module ``dkan_frontend``
 4. Change the sites configuration to point the homepage (``/``) to ``/home``
 5. The app's README will also have instructions for how you can customize the colors and layout to meet your needs.
