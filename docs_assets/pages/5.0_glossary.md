#### Dataset
A dataset is an identifiable collection of structured data objects (distribution list) unified by some criteria (authorship, subject, scope, spatial or temporal extentâ€¦) this is called metadata.

#### JSON Schema
Schema is a human and machine readable vocabulary that allows you to annotate a list of properties and validate JSON documents.

#### Metadata
**Metadata** is structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage a data resource. The challenge is to define and name standard metadata fields so that a data consumer has sufficient information to find, process and understand the described data. The more information that can be conveyed in a standardized regular format, the more valuable data becomes.

There are a number of specifications for dataset metadata. By default, DKAN ships with a ["Project Open Data"](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/)-inspired schema for [datasets](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan2/tree/master/schema).
