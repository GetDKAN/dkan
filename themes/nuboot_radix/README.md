# Nuboot Radix theme

This is the default theme for DKAN 1.0 -> https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan


## Installation

Your theme will use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to compile Sass. Gulp needs Node.

#### Step 1
Make sure you have Node and npm installed.
You can read a guide on how to install node here: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

#### Step 2
Install bower: `npm install -g bower`.

#### Step 3
Go to the root of your theme and run the following commands: `npm run setup`.

#### Step 4
Update `browserSyncProxy` in **config.json**.

#### Step 5
Edit the files under the **scss** and **js** directory, these will be compiled into the **assets** directory.
Run the following command to compile Sass and watch for changes: `gulp`.

## Using Drush to Create a New Subtheme

When you need more control over the theme or prefer to keep customizations in code without using overrides, creating a subtheme of NuBoot Radix is an easy win. The subtheme will pick up all styles from the chain in cascading order: Radix > NuBoot Radix > Your Subtheme

So you only need to add styles where you want to override the upstream css, and add custom templates if you need specific changes to the layout.

To create a Nuboot Radix subtheme, run these command

```drush en radix```

```drush vset theme_default radix```

```drush radix "MyThemeName" --kit=https://github.com/GetDKAN/radix-kit-nuboot/archive/master.zip```

```drush vset theme_default MyThemeName```

```drush dis radix```

OR if using Ahoy:

```ahoy dkan theme new-from-kit [new-theme-name]```

```ahoy dkan theme setup```

```ahoy dkan theme watch```

The new subtheme will be placed in to the /sites/all/themes/ directory, it will contain the proper directory structure to get you started. 


## Updating subthemes that were based on Radix 7.x-rc4

To upgrade an older NuBoot Radix subtheme to use the new Radix 7.x-3.3 compiling process, it will need to be done manually, follow the steps outlined here:

## Use

Use the components directory to break out your styles into easy to find partial files. Add as many partial files as needed to theme new or more specific sections of your site. This helps keep the styles organized, allowing for easy customizations and quick to find elements for all team members. Do not add styles directly to the nuboot_radix.style.scss file, this file simply determines the order in which the theme files are compiled.
