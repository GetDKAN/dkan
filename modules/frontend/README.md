## DKAN Frontend Module (DEPRECATED)

This module provides support for decoupled frontend apps. It has been deprecated in favor
of [dkan_js_frontend](../modules/dkan_js_frontend/README.md), please do not enable on new projects. Once we are sure no existing
sites are still depending on this module, it will be removed from the codebase.
