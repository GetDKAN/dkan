In an attempt at making some tests more sociable and realistic, we are reducing some mocking and trying to use real classes. One of this examples is the FileMapper tests in which many Drupal classes (StreamWrapper, FileSystem, etc) are used. On of this clsses requires a folder to exist, and that is why this empty folder named file exists. The code that checks for the folder is in Drupal's LocalStream class.
