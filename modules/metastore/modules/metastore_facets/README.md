# Metastore Facets

This is an optional module that will provide facet examples that you can use if you are building a data catalog with a Drupal theme rather than the decoupled frontend.

The default config will place the facets in sidebar regions of Drupal's core themes. Visit /admin/structure/block to place the facet blocks into the region where you would like them to display. Then restrict the display to the /dataset-search page only.
