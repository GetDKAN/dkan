      "description":"In late 2016, the URA, in conjunction with Reinvestment Fund, completed the 2016 Market Value Analysis (MVA) for the City of Pittsburgh. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipalityâ€™s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional neighborhood boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.",

Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that over 339 million individuals grapple with asthma, a chronic respiratory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. The prevalence of asthma varies across regions and is influenced by factors such as genetics, environmental exposures, and socio-economic conditions. In some developed nations, urbanization and increased exposure to allergens contribute to higher rates of asthma. Moreover, disparities in healthcare access and quality can impact the prevalence and management of asthma, with vulnerable populations often facing greater challenges. Efforts to address asthma prevalence involve public health initiatives, education, and research aimed at understanding the multifaceted factors influencing the condition, ultimately contributing to better prevention and management strategies.",

Administered typically in two doses, the varicella vaccine not only provides direct protection against chickenpox but also contributes to the prevention of more severe complications and the potential reactivation of the virus as shingles later in life.
