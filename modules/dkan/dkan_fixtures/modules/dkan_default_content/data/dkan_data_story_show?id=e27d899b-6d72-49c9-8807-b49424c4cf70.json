We rely on synthesis to make sense of walls a numbers. Visual synthesis clearly demonstrates patterns and trends. Visualizations can also highlight spikes that imply significant events or interventions. The charts below show how the intervention of the chicken pox vaccine had dramatic impact by showing the change in data over time. Both incident and mortality rates saw a large decrease with the introduction of the vaccine.</p>\n"
