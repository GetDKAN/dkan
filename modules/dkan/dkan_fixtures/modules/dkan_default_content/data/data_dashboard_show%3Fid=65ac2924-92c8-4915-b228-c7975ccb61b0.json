Bike lanes are a core part of pedestrian, bicyclist, and automotive safety. They show clear right-of-way paths and encourage everyone to follow traffic safety rules. You can create your own data visualizations using digital tools and embed them onto your DKAN site. \r\n\r\nThe data released by the Miami-Dade MPO provide information about the number of bike lanes, the start and stop points, etc. With the visualization above we see the data as more than a list. It's easy to see exactly where bike lanes exist and how much area is covered in relation to the entire county. This data, along with other datasets, inform long-term plans for pedestrian and bicycle safety. The [Miami-Dade MPO 2040 plan for pedestrian bicycle safety](http://miamidadempo.org/library/plans/miami-dade-2040-bicycle-pedestrian-plan.pdf) identifies major improvements that will be achieved over the next few decades.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<center>[Go to Data](../dataset/florida-bike-lanes/resource/960687d8-582c-4f29-b1e4-113781e58e3b)</center>",
