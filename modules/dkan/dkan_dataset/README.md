# DKAN Dataset

This is a Drupal module containing the content types and other functionality to publish Open Data sets in Drupal.

DKAN Dataset is a standalone module that can be added to any existing Drupal 7 site.

DKAN Dataset is part of the [DKAN](https://drupal.org/project/dkan "DKAN homepage") project which includes the [DKAN profile](https://drupal.org/project/dkan "DKAN homepage") which creates a standalone Open Data portal, and [DKAN Datastore](https://drupal.org/project/dkan_datastore "DKAN Datastore homepage") which is a module that can be coupled with DKAN Dataset to offer a datastore and data previews.

DKAN Dataset is currently managed in code on Github but is mirrored on Drupal.org.

## INSTALLATION

This module REQUIRES implementers to use "drush make". If you only use "drush download" you will miss key dependencies for required modules and libraries.

See installation instructions here: http://docs.getdkan.com/dkan-documentation/dkan-developers/adding-dkan-features-existing-drupal-site#Installing_DKAN_Dataset
