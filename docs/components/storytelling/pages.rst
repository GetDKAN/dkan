Using the in-place editor (IPE)
-------------------------------

The In-Place Editor (IPE) interface at its core it is a drag and drop content manager that lets you visually design a layout and place content within that layout. 

DKAN's customized IPE interface
********************************

DKAN has simplified the list of IPE options to show only the most used options, this makes adding and editing content a faster and less daunting process.


Editing existing panels-based content
