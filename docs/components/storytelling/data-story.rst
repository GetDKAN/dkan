Data Stories
==============

Data Stories show the people in data. It's not always obvious how rows and columns can make a difference in the world of citizens. Data Stories help show the impact data can make in our everyday lives by adding context and synthesis through a narrative form. This content type is easy to use and similar to writing a blog post. Use Data Stories to combine narrative, media, and data for a compelling way to connect to data.

**Add a Data Story when you're trying to:**

* Tell the story within the data.
* Show the impact of data on citizens' daily lives.
* Demonstrate the value and return on investment of open data.
