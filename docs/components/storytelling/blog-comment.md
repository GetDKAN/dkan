# Blog and Comment Modules

## Adding a blog section to your site

Adding a blog section of your site is easy with DKAN. Drupal core, and thus DKAN, comes with a "blog" module that can be enabled at '/admin/modules'. However we don't recommend using the default blog module as there are better options available.

### Debut Blog
The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/debut_blog">Debut Blog</a> module has a more feature rich blog including better layout and media handling. Debut Blog's needs only to be installed and doesn't require extensive configuration.

### Create Custom Blog
Drupal's user interface is so powerful that it is possible to create a blog section completely through the user interface. See <a href="https://www.ostraining.com/blog/drupal/build-wordpress-in-drupal/">How to Build a WordPress Blog in Drupal</a> for an example.

## Comments

Drupal core has a comment module that is included with DKAN.

Enabling comments is as easy as turning on the core Comment module.

Once you have done that new datasets will have a comment box at the bottom.

For already created datasets you will need to click "Comment settings" and "open" for each datasets:

**It is highly recommended to read â€‹<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/777676">Drupal's comment documentation</a>** which has some more info on administering and configuring comments.
