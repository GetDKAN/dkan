DKAN Topics
===========

While DKAN includes a free-tagging tags/keywords field for datasets, many data portals organize datasets into more predefined categories by subject matter. These are usually a small collection of subjects with logos that are incorporated into the site navigation. Neither DKAN's tags or "groups" (which are designed for grouping user permissions and usually represent organizational divisions) are exactly appropriate for this task.

The DKAN Topics module adds a "topics" vocabulary to DKAN, and corresponding functionality throughout the site. It adds a facet to the search/datasets page, and a pane to the default homepage. Topics can be administered through the standard Drupal taxonomy interface.

The included `DKAN Default Topics <https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan/tree/7.x-1.x/modules/dkan/dkan_topics/modules/dkan_default_topics>`_ module will add, on enable, a set of default civic topics using the `Taxonomy Fixtures <https://github.com/GetDKAN/taxonomy_fixtures>`_ module.

DKAN Topics is enabled by default on new DKAN installations, with default terms loaded into the vocabulary. The module can be disabled and uninstalled, and all existing topics will be removed.

Known Issues
------------------------------------
* This module adds a main menu link for "Topics". If you want a different word in place of "Topics", you can change the name in the main menu configuration but the icons in the dropdown will stop working. If you use `String Overrrides <https://www.drupal.org/project/stringoverrides>`_ you can change the Menu link title and the icons will continue to work, however the facet block title and the dataset form field title will still display as 'Topics'.
* Adding a new icon font for use with topics **needs work** to keep the icon functionality in facets and menus from breaking.
