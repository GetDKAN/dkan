Visualization Entity
=========================
Visualization Entity is included in the DKAN distribution.

This module **aims** to provide:

- A base drupal entity to extend and create **visualization bundles**.
- A set of visualization bundles that provide functionality out of the box for the module and indicate a good example for extending this entity.
- A set of permissions common to all visualization bundles.
- A common "iframe view" shared between all visualization bundles.
- A common "embed" functionality shared between all visualization bundles.
