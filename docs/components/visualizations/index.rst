Visualizations
======================

DKAN provides visualization functionality in two primary ways: through the
automatically-created "data previews" that are displayed with data :ref:`resources <resources>`,
and the more-complex and manually-build visualization "entities":

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Data Previews <datapreviews>
   Visualization Entity <visualization_entity/index>

Additional visualization functionality can be found in the following projects,
which are not included in the core DKAN project and are still in a relatively
expiremental state:

* `DKAN Datastore CartoDB Integration <https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan_datastore_cartodb>`_
* `React Dash library <https://react-dashboard.readthedocs.io>`_
