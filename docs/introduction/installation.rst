Installation
============

This document contains instructions for installing the DKAN open data
publishing software on your webserver. If you’re not comfortable
installing and maintaining server software, you may wish to Deploy a
Ready-to-Run DKAN Instance instead.

Please note that we are in the process of revamping our installation and
upgrade guide. The instructions here will work, but please bear with us
as we develop better documentation and processes.

Before getting started, it's recommended that you familiarize yourself
with:

-  `Drush, the command line tool <http://docs.drush.org/en/master/>`__
-  `Drupal's installation
   process <https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install>`__
-  `Drupal's upgrade process <https://www.drupal.org/upgrade>`__
-  `Drupal profiles and
   distributions <https://www.drupal.org/node/1089736#distributions-vs-installation-profiles>`__

What you will find in the main `DKAN
Repository <https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan>`__ is a Drupal
*installation profile*. To set up a working website using DKAN, you will
need to acquire or build a full DKAN distribution of Drupal.

.. tip:: `DKAN Starter <http://dkan-starter.readthedocs.io>`_ is project
  containing a prebuilt version of DKAN and the tools `CivicActions
  <https://civicactions.com/dkan/>`_ uses for our own implementations and
  deployments. Learn more advanced workflows in that project's
  `documentation <https://dkan-starter.readthedocs.io>`_.

Requirements
------------

Operating Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DKAN is based on Drupal software and -- generally -- runs anywhere
Drupal is supported. This document assumes installation on a Linux-based
Apache webserver using MySQL as a back-end database (aka LAMP server).
For other environments, please see our Alternative Environment Support.

-  MySQL: minimum version 5.0.15+ with PDO
-  before installation, please create one MySQL database and associated
   user.
-  PHP: minimum version 5.3.x
-  Apache: minimum version 2.x
-  Git

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

DKAN has been successfully tested in limited-resource environments, such
as Amazon’s “micro” AWS instance, for development.

-  Minimum RAM: 1GB for development, 2GB or more recommended for
   production.
-  Minimum Disk: 64M for base installation, recommended 1GB or more for
   production.

DKAN is based on Drupal and follows the same basic installation
procedure as any Drupal distribution. More information about various
requirements can be located in the `Drupal Installation
Guide <https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install>`__.

Pre Installation
----------------

Using fully made version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment, our supported fully-made DKAN codebase is the `DKAN
DROPS-7 <https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-drops-7>`__ repository, which
is optimized to run on the Pantheon platform. You can build a DKAN site
with a single click on Pantheon
`here <https://dashboard.getpantheon.com/products/dkan/spinup>`__. (We
also offer `one-click installation on
Acquia <http://docs.getdkan.com/dkan-documentation/get-dkan/dkan-acquia>`__)

Download and unzip `the latest version of the "DKAN DROPS"
codebase <https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-drops-7/archive/master.zip>`__
on your server webroot.

if you want to do this with git instead:

::

    $ git clone --branch master https://github.com/nuams/dkan-drops-7.git dkan

Build your own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This "builds" a full DKAN website codebase from the bleeding-edge
development version of DKAN, by downloading Drupal and all the
additional modules that DKAN needs to run. You may want to use this
method to get recent changes that have not yet been included in an
official release, or to use a branch or forked version of the DKAN
profile.

Note that ``rsync`` is used to copy the DKAN profile inside the Drupal
``/profiles`` folder. You may wish to modify this process to fit your
own development practices.

Requires drush version 8.x.

::

    $ git clone --branch 7.x-1.x https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan.git
    $ cd dkan
    $ drush make --prepare-install drupal-org-core.make webroot --yes
    $ rsync -av . webroot/profiles/dkan --exclude webroot
    $ drush -y make --no-core --contrib-destination=./ drupal-org.make webroot/profiles/dkan --no-recursion
    $ cd webroot

You can also build from a specific release of DKAN by checkout out the
correct tag after cloning. For instance:

::

    $ git clone --branch 7.x-1.x https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan.git
    $ git checkout tags/7.x-1.11
    ...

The automated software builder will download and configure the latest
version of DKAN and prepare it for installation. When complete, proceed
to “Installing the DKAN Software” section below.

Note before proceeding: Recline previews require `clean
URLs <https://www.drupal.org/getting-started/clean-urls#enabling-7>`__

Installation
------------

Once you’ve downloaded the DKAN software, it’s time to install it. If
you’ve previously installed Drupal, this process will be very similar.

With drush
~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ drush site-install dkan --db-url="mysql://DBUSER:DBPASS@localhost/DBNAME"

You can add the ``--verbose`` switch if you want to see every step. The
installation should end with ``drush`` creating an admin account with a
random password, which will be output in a message to the terminal.

With the web installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Open a web browser and visit **http://YOURDKANSITE/install.php**:

.. figure:: ../images/install-language.png
   :alt: Installation Screen

   Installation Screen

-  The first installation screen is a language selection menu. Although
   DKAN does provide limited multi-language support, installation must
   currently be performed in English. Continue.
-  At this point, your server resources and capabilities are checked to
   ensure they meet DKAN installation requirements. All errors must be
   corrected before installation can proceed. Instructions for
   correcting each error condition are provided.

.. figure:: ../images/install-database.png
   :alt: Installation Screen - database config

   Installation Screen

-  Once your server meets all installation requirements, you’ll be
   presented with the database configuration screen. Enter your MySQL
   database name, database username, and database password, then click
   “Save to Continue” to proceed.

.. figure:: ../images/install-progress.png
   :alt: Progress Bar

   Progress Bar

-  The installation will proceed, displaying a progress bar on the
   screen. Depending on your server resources, this may take several
   minutes.

.. figure:: ../images/install-config-screen.png
   :alt: Configuration Screen

   Configuration

-  When installation is complete, the site configuration screen will be
   displayed. Follow the prompts to set your administrative username,
   email address, site name, time zone, and other default settings as
   shown. If the final configuration completes without error, you’ll see
   a short congratulatory message and you’ll be prompted to access your
   new site.
-  Proceed to “\ `DKAN - Data
   Management <http://docs.getdkan.com/v1/data>`__\ ” or “\ `DKAN - User
   Management <http://docs.getdkan.com/v1/users>`__ ” next to continue
   setting up your new DKAN server.

Install for development
-----------------------

This method is particularly useful for people who want to work on the
DKAN project itself, as it preserves Git versioning information in every
profile, theme and module directory. The core developers use this method
when developing and testing DKAN.

Grab Development version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ git clone --branch 7.x-1.x https://github.com/nuams/dkan.git
    $ cd dkan

Build dkan
~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ drush make --prepare-install drupal-org-core.make webroot --yes
    $ rsync -av . webroot/profiles/dkan --exclude webroot
    $ drush -y make --no-core --working-copy --contrib-destination=./ drupal-org.make webroot/profiles/dkan --no-recursion --concurrency=3
    $ cd webroot
