DKAN Harvest
==============
.. _harvest:

The DKAN **Harvest** module enables you to use the public feed or API of another data portal and
import items from that portal's catalog into your own.

For example, `Data.gov <https://data.gov/>`_ harvests all of its datasets from the
`data.json <https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/>`_ files of `hundreds of U.S. federal,
state and local data portals <https://catalog.data.gov/harvest>`_.
