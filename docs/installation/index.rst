Installation
===============

This document contains instructions for installing the DKAN open data
publishing software on your webserver. If youâ€™re not comfortable
installing and maintaining server software, you may wish to
:doc:`use web-based tools to deploy to Pantheon <../introduction/get-dkan>` 
instead.

Please note that we are in the process of revamping our installation and
upgrade guide. The instructions here will work, but please bear with us
as we develop better documentation and processes.
