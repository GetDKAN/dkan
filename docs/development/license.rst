Customizing the License Field
=============================

In order to add options to the existing ones you need to implement `hook_license_subscribe` in the following fashion:

.. code-block:: php

  // Let's assume we want to do this as part of the fictitious license_options_extra module
  function license_options_extra_license_subscribe() {
    return array(
      'tcl' => array(
        'label' => 'Talis Community License (TCL)',
        'uri' => 'http://opendefinition.org/licenses/tcl/',
      ),
    );
  }

The code above add the **Talis Community License (TCL)** license referencing it to the **tcl** key. It also provides a link to the license (optional). You can provide as many options as you want through the array being returned.

Removing License Options
------------------------

In order to remove options from the existing ones you need to implement `hook_license_unsubscribe` in the following fashion:

.. code-block:: php

  // Let's assume we want to do this as part of the fictitious license_options_extra module
  function license_options_extra_license_unsubscribe() {
    return array(
      'notspecified',
    );
  }


The code above removes the **notspecified** option. You can provide as many options as you want through the array being returned.

Additional notes about the behavior of both hooks
-------------------------------------------------

* The options provided through the license drupal field configuration are **COMPLETELY** ignored.
* ``hook_license_subscribe()`` implementations are of course called before ``hook_license_unsubscribe()`` implementations.
* Options subscribed through ``hook_license_subscribe()`` are processed as they come through the order of modules provided by the drupal registry.
* If multiple options are provided using the same key then it grabs the first one that comes in and ignores the rest
* If you want to **replace** and item that already exists, unsubscribe the existing key and provided an alternative one for your option
