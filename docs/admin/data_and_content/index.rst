Data and Content
================

On DKAN the data you publish for site visitors is handled as content. Treating data like content makes it easier for general site visitors to consume information and accessible for people.  

Equally important is making your open data accessible for computers (ie machine-usable). Technologists leverage this access by developing applications to interact with your open data programmatically. This opens an entire realm of possibilities.  

DKAN is provides tools for generating content for the technical and non-technical users of your open data site, along with tools for Site Managers to monitor and manage that content. The following sections explain all of those capabilities.
