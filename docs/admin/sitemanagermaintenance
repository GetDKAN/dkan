# Site Manager Monthly Maintenance Checklist


### Content
*(Accessible via the “Content” tab on the black site administration toolbar)*

- Check the “Content” list for an overview of the content currently hosted on your site. 

- Is there any content that needs to be published or unpublished? Are there duplicates? If so, take a moment to clean up your content.

### Groups
*(Accessible via the “Groups” button on the main site navigation bar)*

- Is the Groups list up to date? 

- Does each Group have an appropriate image and description?

### Tags and Taxonomies
*(Mouse over Site Configuration on the black site administration toolbar, then click “Taxonomy”)*

- Check your site’s list of Tags, located in the Taxonomy menu. To view a list of all Tags on the site, click “List terms.” 

- Are there any misspelled tags? Are there any duplicate tags? If so, take a moment to clean up your tags.

### User management
*(Accessible via the “People” tab on the black site administration toolbar)*

- Is the user list up to date? For site security, always double-check that there aren’t any accounts accessible to users who have left your organization. If this is the case, their accounts should be canceled or blocked.

- Do all of the users in your organization have the proper site roles? (Site Manager, Editor, Content Creator.)

### Workbench (Optional, if the Workbench/Workflow Modules have been enabled)
*(Accessible via the “My Workbench” tab in the site administration bar)*

- Workbench moderation queue tasks - check each of these tabs:

**My drafts**
- Are there any drafts that ought to be pushed to “Published” or “Needs Review”?

**Needs review**
- Are there any items under review that ought to be pushed back to “Draft” or published?

**Stale drafts**
- These are drafts that have been unmoderated for over 72 hours. Make sure content doesn’t build up under this queue!

**Stale reviews**
- These are items under review that have been unmoderated for over 72 hours.
