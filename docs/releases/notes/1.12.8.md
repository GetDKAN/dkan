# DKAN 1.12.8 Release Notes

**Special note:** This release contains *security updates* and should be applied immediately.

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates to DKAN 7.x-1.12, but adding no new functionality. Upgrading should be straightforward.

## Improvements in this release
- Updates the [Panels](https://www.drupal.org/project/panels) and [Panelizer](https://www.drupal.org/project/panelizer) modules following critical security releases. See Drupal security advisories [DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2016-047](https://www.drupal.org/node/2785631) and [DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-048](https://www.drupal.org/node/2785687).
- Added validation to groups node form to prevent user from creating duplicate groups. Saving a group will now fail if there is an existing group with the same name.
