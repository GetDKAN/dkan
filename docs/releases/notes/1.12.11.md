# DKAN 1.12.11 Release Notes

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates to DKAN 7.x-1.12, but adding no new functionality. Upgrading should be straightforward.

## Improvements in this release
- Fixed a bug in Recline regarding file objects and node forms that caused errors when using the "view changes" button on Dataset or Resource edit form
- Center group images in "Groups" page and group node page sidebar
- Add "2x," "3x" etc to Dataset teasers when more than one resource of a particular format present.
- Update the default jquery library setting from 1.7 to 1.10
- Fixed topics menu and facet links if special characters are used in topic terms.
- Fixed dataset form redirect when validation fails, was sending user to node/add/dataset rather than node/%/edit
- Patch fontyourface to remove
from the "standard text" selector, to prevent unpredictable results from this option
- Fixed issue in open_data_schema_map with "Data Dictionary" field not displaying URL in data.json file
