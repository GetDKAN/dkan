DKAN 1.13.1 Release Notes
=========================

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates to DKAN 1.13, but adding no new functionality. It was released very shortly after 1.13 to address bugs that surfaced during deployments and upgrades. If you have not yet upgraded to 1.13, upgrade *directly* to this release and skip 1.13; if you have already upgraded, we recommend updating to 1.13.1 immediately.

:doc:`See full 1.13 release notes here <1.13>`.
