# DKAN 1.12.4 Release Notes

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates to DKAN 7.x-1.12, but adding no new functionality. Upgrading should be straightforward.

## Improvements in this release
- Fixes an oversight that broke RDF endpoints for Datasets (the "RDF" link in the left sidebar of a dataset page). The [DKAN Permissions](https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan/tree/7.x-1.x/modules/dkan/dkan_permissions) module did not give the "Access the resource node" _RESTFull Web Services_ permission to anonymous users.

## Upgrade steps
Only necessary if you are using DKAN Permissions module:

`$ drush features-revert dkan_permissions`
