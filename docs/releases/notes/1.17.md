# DKAN 1.17 Release notes

## What's new

### DKAN Periodic Updates

The DKAN Periodic Updates module provides automated datastore updates on existing resources on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. If you have resources that change often and need the data to be re-imported to the datastore on a regular basis this feature is for you. It is included with DKAN core but will not be enabled by default. Consult the [documentation](https://dkan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/components/periodic-updates.html) on how to set up and configure.

### Miscellaneous improvements

This release includes updates and bug fixes to DKAN Workflow, Open Data Schema Mapper, and accessibility compliance.

### The decommissioning of Feeds
The 7.x-1.16 release introduced a refactored DKAN Datastore that no longer relied the feeds module. In this release we are disabling feeds and its companion modules so that in the next release they can be completely removed.

> ⚠️ This release **disables** and **uninstalls** the feeds module. If you are using [feeds](https://drupal.org/project/feeds) on your site outside of the DKAN open data operations, be sure to backup your database and restore after upgrading or comment out the update hook dkan_update_7035.
