DKAN 1.13.4
===========

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates, but adding no new functionality.

Improvements in this release
----------------------------

- Some logic concerning when previews were rendered for resources has been simplified. DKAN will now attempt 
to render a preview for any resource that contains an *uploaded* or *remote* file. No *API or Website URL* 
links in resources will be previewed other than with an iframe to the URL. Note that in some cases, resources
that previously did have Recline previews may now simply display an iframe to the remote resource.

Special Notes
-------------
