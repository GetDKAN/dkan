# DKAN 1.12.5 Release Notes

**Special note:** This release contains *security updates* and should be applied immediately.

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates to DKAN 7.x-1.12, but adding no new functionality. Upgrading should be straightforward.

## Improvements in this release
- Updates the [RESTFull Web Services module](https://www.drupal.org/project/restws) to 7.x-2.6, fixing a [highly critical security issue announced by the Drupal Security team on July 13](https://www.drupal.org/node/2765567).
- Updates the version of recline.js used in the [Recline module](https://github.com/GetDKAN/recline) to point to a new source for map tiles. Previously map tiles were served by MapQuest, but a change in policy has broken map previews on all applications using recline.js. See the original PR on recline.js: okfn/recline#501
- **Updates Drupal core to version 7.50.**

## Special Note
This is a fairly big update to Drupal and you may want to familiarize yourself with it by reading the [release announcement](https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-7-50).

Of note to DKAN users is that "Administer fields" is now a separate permission. This means, for instance that site managers and editors, who by default have "administer taxonomy vocabularies" permissions, will no longer be able to add, remove, reorder or otherwise modify fields in a taxonomy vocabulary.

Only administrators will be able to do administer fields. We see this as a welcome improvement, as making minor changes to, say, the topics vocabulary should not require giving a site manager permission to alter the entire data architecture.
