DKAN 1.13.3 (future release)
============================

Placeholder for good things to come.

Update instructions
-------------------

This update changes the way the Harvest module reflects the issued and modified dates of harvested datasets. Two new fields are added, and an existing field, ``field_modified_source_date``, is removed. All sources should be re-harvested after updating to this patch release to ensure that all date fields and properties are accurate.
