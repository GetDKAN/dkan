# DKAN 1.12.3 Release Notes

**Special note:** This release contains *security updates* and should be applied immediately.

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates to DKAN 7.x-1.12, but adding no new functionality. Upgrading should be straightforward.

## Improvements in this release

  - Stories main menu link removed from stories view
  - Groups main menu link removed from page manager groups page config
  - Main menu links added on install function rather than through features
