# DKAN 1.12.13 Release Notes

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates to DKAN 7.x-1.12, but adding no new functionality. Upgrading should be straightforward.

## Improvements in this release
- Fixed broken recline (resource CSV) preview embeds caused by how recline module loads bootstrap.
- Added patch to remote_stream_wrapper to avoid memory exhausted errors on big files.
- Fixed publisher token in open_data_schema_map_dkan. It was showing only URL rather than publisher name.
- Remote linked files are now proxied through a DKAN site so that we don't run into CORS issues for the visualizations. That can cause memory issues with large files. This only proxies files smaller than 50MB.
