# DKAN 1.12.2 Release Notes

This is a "patch" release of DKAN, containing bug fixes and minor updates to DKAN 7.x-1.12, but adding no new functionality. Upgrading should be straightforward.

## Improvements in this release
- Fixed a bug in chart creation with [Visualization Entity Charts](https://github.com/GetDKAN/visualization_entity_charts) due to a reference to an [incorrect version of csv.js in the Recline makefule](https://github.com/GetDKAN/recline/commit/66dd041dbcc74a07a27e68ad488a68a59dcf07f0)
