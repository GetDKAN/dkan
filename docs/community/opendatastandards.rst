Open Data Standards & Tidy Data
===============================

A basic overview of open data standards and best practices.

The open data publishing process from start-to-finish

   This flowchart displays the steps of the open data publishing process.

Datasets, Resources and Groups
------------------------------

How DKAN organizes data
***********************
All open data catalogs built on DKAN are organized by Datasets, Resources and Groups.

These three content types serve as a means of organizing data for maximum site functionality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

You can picture a DKAN-based open data portal as a massive file cabinet, as in the below diagram:

.. figure:: ../images/DKANFileCabinet.png

   This image displays a DKAN Open Data site as a file cabinet with Datasets, Resources and Groups represented as folders, files and drawers.

:Datasets:  Datasets are used to group related pieces of data and their associated metadata. These pieces of data - known as Resources - can then be found under a single url along with descriptions and licensing information.

            Datasets serve as the folders for the Resources within. In real life, a typical folder could contain a printed spreadsheet, a PDF of a map, and a CD-ROM within it. In DKAN, you can similarly add a wide number of Resources in various formats to a single Dataset.
:Resources: In DKAN, Resources are the actual files, APIs or links that are being shared within a Dataset. See the "Dataset" definition for an image of a Dataset containing two Resources.

            Resource types include csv, html, xls, json, xlsx, doc, docx, rdf, txt, jpg, png, gif, tiff, pdf, odf, ods, odt, tsv, geojson and xml files.

            If the Resource is an API, it can be used as a live source of information for building a site or application.

            Resources can be viewed within your browser using DKAN Data Previews or used to create visualizations.
:Groups:    Each Group is home to Datasets and Resources that share a common publisher.

            Typically, the publisher is an organization or governmental agency (i.e. Dept. of Education, Health Care Administration, Transit Authority, etc.).

            Groups also enable you to assign roles and permissions to members of the group. By adding users to the Group’s membership roster, you can create and manage a community based around the data within the group.

Metadata
--------

The "Who, What, When, Where, Why" of data

What is metadata?
*****************

As mentioned above, metadata is the "Who, What, When, Where, Why" of data.

To return to the file cabinet metaphor, metadata is the information written on the outside of each folder about the folder itself and the contents within.

Metadata contains the attributes that describe each dataset. Examples include the name of the dataset’s author, the title of the dataset, the date that it was last updated, any relevant contact information associated with the dataset, and more.

Metadata can be qualitative or quantitative in nature. Quantitative data is data that can be evaluated numerically; if the variable can be counted or measured, it’s quantitative. Qualitative data is data that is descriptive, and cannot be measured.

**An example of qualitative metadata:**

"Author: Leslie Knope, Agency: Dept. of Parks and Recreation."

**An example of quantitative metadata:**

"Downloaded: 311 times, Last Accessed: 03-16-2016, 5:51 p.m."


Where is metadata displayed in DKAN?
************************************

When viewing a dataset, you can scroll down the page to the "Dataset Info" section to view its metadata.

The screencap below is an example of metadata for the "Safety Net Clinics" dataset on `HealthData.gov <http://www.healthdata.gov/>`_:

.. figure:: ../images/MetadataInDKAN.png

   Metadata in DKAN is displayed as a table on the Datasets page

Open Data Formats
-----------------
An open data format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone.

Common open file formats include csv, html, xls, json, xlsx, doc, docx, rdf, txt, jpg, png, gif, tiff, pdf, odf, ods, odt, tsv, geojson and xml files.

All of the above file formats are supported as data resources in DKAN.

CSV Files
*****************

**Introduction**

A CSV (comma-separated values) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, with each line of the file serving as a data record. Each record is made up of one or more fields, separated by commas - this usage of the comma as a field separator explains the name of the format.

In plain English, CSV files are a handy way to store data that could otherwise be displayed as a table. The structure of CSV files makes them easy to parse by nearly every database, spreadsheet or statistical analysis application in existence - including, of course, DKAN.

Here is an example of how a CSV file stores a table containing the quiz grades of four students, sorted by date:

"Date","Student","Grade"

"March 16th","Smith, Sally","A"

"March 25th","Williams, Jane","B"

"April 1st","Smith, Sally","C"

"April 8th","Doe, Jonathan ""Johnny""","A"

Exported as a table, it looks very similar:

=============== ======================= ======
Date            Student                 Grade
=============== ======================= ======
March 16th      Smith, Sally            A
March 25th      Williams, Jane          B
April 1st       Smith, Sally            C
April 8th       Doe, Jonathan "Johnny"  A
=============== ======================= ======


Each field is separated by a comma, and each new line represents a separate data record.

There are no official standards for the CSV file format itself, given that it has been in use since 1972 before such file format standards existed. That’s right - this widely-accessible format that can store millions of data records in a single file has existed and been in continuous use since the days of punch-card computing.

This is because CSV files have always been easy to type, are less prone to producing incorrect results if a record is entered incorrectly, and as shown above, is easily human-readable. These are still the major advantages of the format when it comes to viewing, editing, accessing and storing open data.

**Possible issues with storing data resources in CSV format**

One issue users may encounter with delimiter-separated files is the usage of an alternative delimiter such as a semicolon or tab instead of a comma. These files may be mistakenly saved as .csv files, causing problems when a program built to parse comma-delimited files attempts to read them. **

CSV Files vs. Microsoft Excel (.XLS) files in DKAN
***************************************************

CSV files can also only contain one "page" of data; therefore, unlike in Microsoft Excel, you cannot save a “workbook” with multiple pages representing multiple tables.

For example, if you had multiple pages of student grade data in Excel - one for the students of the Fall 2015 class, one for the Spring 2016 class and another for Summer 2016 - these would have to be saved as three separate CSV files.

On the other hand, CSV files can contain millions upon millions of rows. There is literally *no limit* to how long they can be, making them more practical than XLS files, which can only contain 65536 rows and 256 columns.

When would you need millions of rows? Examples include: All of the traffic tickets issued by a major metropolitan city within a calendar year, or open transit data containing a data record for every single bus arrival at every bus stop for every single route in the city. For NYC, these real-life open data files are truly massive, beyond what Excel can handle.

**Issues you may encounter when importing data via Microsoft Excel**

Excel will open .csv files, but as mentioned, depending on the system’s regional settings, it may expect a semicolon as a separator as opposed to a comma. This is because, in some countries and languages, the comma is used as the decimal separator. (i.e. displaying the number 3.14 as 3,14.)

Excel may also auto-reformat what looks like numbers, eliminating leading + or 0 characters. This can break data records starting with those characters, such as phone numbers. Many regional versions of Excel also cannot deal with Unicode in CSV files.

One solution when encountering these issues while attempting to open a CSV file in Excel is to change the filename extension from .csv to .txt; then opening the file manually with the Excel "Open" command. This will allow you to manually specify the delimiters, encoding, format of columns, etc. A preview is displayed so that you can be sure the file looks the way you want it to.

When saving a CSV file in Excel, a prompt will appear warning you that Excel’s formatting cannot be saved with the file. This is referring to formatting you may have applied to the file such as bold text, special colors or fonts, added images or anything else that goes beyond the limitations of the format.Each field is separated by a comma, and each new line represents a separate data record.

Data Standards 101
------------------

Data is more useful when more people can use it.

What are data standards?
************************

Data standards are the rules that help keep the publishing and organization of open data orderly and efficient.

If you’re a writer, you may be familiar with the various stylebooks used to standardize the writing and design of documents in terms of grammar, punctuation and sources cited.

Examples include the AP Stylebook for news reports, and the Chicago and MLA manuals of style for academic papers. You can think of the various guidelines in the stylebooks as data standards applied to written content.

A listing of common standards for open data has been provided within this document.

Why do data standards matter?
******************************

Standards for data and metadata formatting and organization matter because of interoperability and functionality between datasets.

One of the most important parts of data analysis is figuring out the relationships between data resources - and if multiple resources have been prepared in a single standardized format, it makes comparing them between one another far more efficient.

One example that pertaining to data standardization is how dates are formatted:

April 2, 1974

04-02-74

04/02/1974

4/2/74

19740402

04021974 - is this April 2 or February 4?

2 April 1974

If you were trying to compare or join together datasets from different sources, each of which used a different format for their date variable, it would be a much more difficult task than if a common date format had been decided upon ahead of time.

For a listing of open data standards resources, please proceed to the bottom of this document.


What makes open data truly ‘open’?
**********************************

The determination of whether data is truly open comes down to three categories:

**Availability and Access**

* The data must be available in a convenient and modifiable form.

* It can be linked to and easily shared with others.

* It has been provided in a standard, structured format so that it is machine-readable and can be easily manipulated.

* Guaranteed availability and consistency over time regarding the data itself as well as its accompanying metadata.

* The data can be traced back to where it originates.


Reuse and Redistribution
*************************

* Open data is data that is free to access, use and share.

* **Universal Participation:** The general public must be able to use, re-use and redistribute the data.


Best Practices for "Tidy Data"
------------------------------

Data cleaning
*************

Data cleaning - also known as data wrangling - is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database.

Cleaning and reorganizing data before it is published on an open data portal is time-consuming but necessary. Not only is it one of the first steps that must be performed when publishing data, but it may end up being repeated many times as new problems come to light or new data is collected. Tidying data makes the sharing and publishing of data more efficient.

Tidying data makes the publishing, sharing and interoperability of data more efficient, and allows it to be read by more software platforms and operating systems than it otherwise would be.

By adhering to tidy data standards, data publishers can ensure that their data can be as accessible as possible to the widest number of users.


What makes tidy data ‘tidy’?
****************************

Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.

Tidy datasets are:

* Easy to manipulate

* Easy to model

* Easy to visualize


Tidy datasets also have a *specific structure* that comes down to three simple rules:

* Each variable is a column.

* Each observation is a row.

* Each type of observational unit is a table.

The following example of student grades is a ‘tidy’ data table: "Date," “Student,” and “Grade,” are all variables, and have been given columns. The observations - corresponding to the dates of each test - have each been given a row.

========== ====================== =====
Test Date  Student                Grade
========== ====================== =====
March 16th Smith, Sally           A
March 25th Williams, Jane         B
April 1st  Smith, Sally           C
April 8th  Doe, Jonathan "Johnny" A
========== ====================== =====



What makes data *untidy*?
*************************

Anything that makes accessibility or visualization difficult can be considered untidy.

A table stored within a Word file is a good example of untidy data because the formatting-within-formatting keeps the data from being machine-readable.

Releasing personally identifying data about individuals or data violating local, national or international privacy laws is not only unethical, but also very much untidy.


How to create quality metadata
------------------------------

Checklist for quality metadata
******************************
To provide quality metadata to users, it is essential to include all of the descriptive information necessary to locate, understand, and use Dataset and its associated Resources.

Metadata should be written in a standard format according to the following best practices:

* **Write simply, completely, and consistently.** General users should be able to understand your metadata and, therefore, understand the Dataset.

* **Use taxonomies** Taxonomies limit terms to those that can be auto-filled and therefore ensure standardization. Within DKAN, Tags and Topics are two examples of taxonomies, also known as "controlled vocabularies."

* **Use specific and descriptive tags.** Tags are essential for users browsing though Datasets and Resources.

* **Provide an appropriate and descriptive title for your Dataset:** For example, the title "Geographic Distribution of City Parks Department Expenditures FY2016" gives users a pretty good idea of what the data is about.

* **Clearly state data limitations, if applicable:** One example would be noting usage constraints such as metadata for a map shapefile that advises "Not to be used for navigational purposes."

* **Avoid using special characters:** The following characters are examples that may affect your metadata's machine-readability: !, @, <, >, (, )

* **Review your metadata's accuracy:** Take a second look at your metadata, and perhaps even ask a colleague if they can look it over.

**Most importantly, you may ask yourself:**

* Could someone use an automatic search to locate this data set?

* Could they assess its usefulness?

* Do your metadata include enough specific information to uniquely identify and locate any geospatial data based solely on your documentation?

* Can a novice understand what you wrote?

* Does the documentation adequately present all the information needed to use or reuse the data represented?

* Are your key words descriptive enough to help other people find your data set?

* Have you used enough broad terms? Have you used enough narrow terms?


Guidelines For Releasing Data or Statistics In Spreadsheets
***********************************************************

`Source: www.cleansheet.org <http://www.clean-sheet.org/>`_

Follow these simple guidelines to make your data or statistical releases as tidy and useful as possible.

1. Don’t merge cells. Sorting and other manipulations people may want to apply to your data assume that each cell belongs to one row and column.

2. Don’t mix data and metadata (e.g. date of release, name of author) in the same sheet.

3. The first row of a data sheet should contain column headers. None of these headers should be duplicates or blank. The column header should clearly indicate which units are used in that column, where this makes sense.

4. The remaining rows should contain data, one datum per row. Don’t include aggregate statistics such as TOTAL or AVERAGE. You can put aggregate statistics in a separate sheet, if they are important.

5. Numbers in cells should just be numbers. Don’t put commas in them, or stars after them, or anything else. If you need to add an annotation to some rows, use a separate column.

6. Use standard identifiers: e.g. identify countries using [ISO 3166](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166) codes rather than names.

7. Don’t use only color or other stylistic cues to encode information. If you want to color cells according to their value, use conditional formatting.

8. Leave the cell blank if a value is not available.

9. If you provide pivot tables, make sure the underlying data is available separately too.

10. If you also want to create a human-friendly presentation of the data, do so by creating another sheet in the same workbook and referencing the appropriate cells in the data sheet.

The 8 Principles of Open Government Data
----------------------------------------
Democratic guidelines regarding open data best practices

**For more information, see:** https://opengovdata.org/

Background
***********

"On December 7-8, 2007, thirty open government advocates gathered in Sebastopol, California and wrote a set of eight principles of open government data.

This page annotates the original 8 principles and links to additional principles found around the web."

The Original 8 Principles of Open Government Data [`Source <https://public.resource.org/8_principles.html>`_]:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  **"Government data shall be considered open if it is made public in a way that complies with the principles below:"**

1. `Complete <http://wiki.opengovdata.org/index.php/Talk:OpenDataPrinciples/complete>`_ All public data is made available. **Public data** is data that is not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations.

2. `Primary <http://wiki.opengovdata.org/index.php/Talk:OpenDataPrinciples/primary>`_ Data is as collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms.
