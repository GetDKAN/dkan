 * Routing-script for the built-in PHP web server.
 *
 * The built-in webserver should only be used for development and testing as it
 * has a number of limitations that makes running Drupal on it highly insecure
 * and somewhat limited.
 *
 * In particular be aware that:
 *   - The server is single-threaded, any requests made during the execution of
 *     the main request will hang until the main request has been completed.
 *   - The webserver does not enforce any of the settings in .htaccess in
 *     particular a remote user will be able to download files that normally
 *     would be protected from direct access such as .module files.
 *
 * Usage:
 * php -S localhost:8888 .ht.router.php
 *
 * @see http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php
